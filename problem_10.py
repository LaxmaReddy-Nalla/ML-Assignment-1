#The diagram below shows a dataset with 2 classes and 8 data points, each with only one feature value, labeled f.
#  Note that there are two data points with the same feature value of 6. These are shown as two xâ€™s one above the other.
#1. Divide this data equally into two parts. Use first part as training and second part as testing.
#  Using KNN classifier, for K=3, what would be the predicted outputs for the test samples? Show how you arrived at your answer.
#2. Compute the confusion matrix for this and calculate accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values.


# dot - girl
# cross - boy

# 1 - girl
# 2 - boy
# 3 - boy
# 4 - nothing
# 5 - nothing
# 6 - boy
# 6 - boy
# 7 - girl
# 8 - nothing
# 9 - nothing
# 10 - girl
# 11 - girl
# 12 - nothing
# 13 - nothing


# assume each output class as boy or girl, say dot means girl, cross means boy
# The dataset that I decided from the diagram is on dataset variable defined below.
# lets seperate the features and outputs into 2 different arrays
# X = [[1], [2] ,[3], [6], [6], [7], [10], [11]] represents features for the given dataset
# y = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] represents classes for these features
# Then I applied a simple KNN algorithm
# Created the confusion matrix with the predicted values and ofc inbuilt methods
# Then I defined accuracy and specificity, sensitivity values as follows (inbuilt methods)
